# heartstart

Czech tech that restarts life. And hearts.

Our app notifies nearby trained responders of a cardiaic arrest. The app shows the responders a map with nearby AED's they can pick up on their way to the emergency.

Our app further improves the organisation of responders reacting to emergencies with the following:

- A list of status updates showing what other responders are doing

- Showing which defibrillators have been picked up and aren't there, to prevent wasted time

- The option to calculate a route through the defibrillator location to the patient (the most optimal route)
